This is my **first** blog post using *markdown*.

### My subheading
Here is an image:


There is a code snippet below:
```typescript
export function myComponent(string: string, number: number){
    return (
        <p>test</p>
    )
}
```

And here is our button:

<Button text="my button" /> 

And here is a table:

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| val 1 | val 2 |
| val 3 | val 4 |
